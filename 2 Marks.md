## Internal Assessment I

### 1. Apply shift cipher to find the original message for the given cipher text. 
**NVVKSBJR**

**Key:** 7  
**Original Message:** "GOOD LUCK"

### 2. Compare Block Cipher with Stream Cipher
| S.No | Block Cipher | Stream Cipher |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| 1.   | Block Cipher converts the plain text into cipher text by taking plain textâ€™s block at a time. | Stream Cipher converts the plain text into cipher text by taking 1 byte of plain text at a time. |
| 2.   | Block cipher uses either 64 bits or more than 64 bits. | Stream cipher uses 8 bits. |
| 3.   | Example: DES, AES | Example: Vernam Cipher |

### 3. Which attack tries to formulate a web resource occupied or busy its users by flooding the URL of the victim with unlimited requests than the server can handle?
a) Phishing attack  
b) DoS attack  
c) Website attack  
d) MiTM attack

**Answer:** b) DoS attack
