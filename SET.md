**Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) Protocol Simplified Explanation:**

SET is like a bodyguard for online credit card transactions, making sure they're safe and sound. It's not a payment system itself, but it's the security guard that watches over payments on the internet.

- **What SET Does:**
  - Keeps credit card details secret from merchants to avoid bad guys.
  - Uses fancy encryption and hashing techniques for extra protection.
  - Had big supporters like Visa, Mastercard, Microsoft, and Netscape.

- **Who's Who in SET:**
  - Customers (Cardholders)
  - Banks (Issuers and Acquirers)
  - Merchants
  - Certificate Authority (the one giving out digital certificates)

- **SET Job List:**
  - **Authentication:** Making sure the right people (customers and merchants) are who they say they are.
  - **Confidentiality:** Keeping messages a secret from nosy outsiders using encryption.
  - **Integrity:** Preventing anyone from messing with messages using digital signatures.
  - **Dual Signature:** Connecting two important pieces of info (Order and Payment) for extra security.

- **Shopping with SET:**
  - Customers check the history between merchants and banks for safety.
  - Credit card use is double-checked using certificates.
  - Messages are encrypted and protected from changes.

- **Dual Signature Magic:**
  - Connects Payment and Order info for extra security.
  - Uses hashing and encryption to create a special signature.

- **Buying Stuff Steps:**
  - Generate a purchase request with Payment and Order info.
  - Validate the request on the merchant's side using special signatures.

- **Payment Time:**
  - Merchant checks the payment info, and if everything's okay, they get the money.

- **SET Challenges:**
  - SET was expected to be a big deal, but it got complicated.
  - Needed special software for users and merchants, slowing things down.
  - Was more complex than other security methods like SSL and TLS.
  - Had issues with translating certificates and wasn't as user-friendly.

In a nutshell, SET was like a superhero for online shopping, but its costume was a bit too fancy for everyone to wear easily. So, other simpler superheroes (like SSL and TLS) became more popular.
